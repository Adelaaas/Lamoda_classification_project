# Lamoda_classification_project

A training project in which it was necessary to parse the site https://www.lamoda.ru/ and build an image classifier into two classes: blouses and trousers.

**Two categories were parsed:**
- https://www.lamoda.ru/c/2483/clothes-bluzy/
- https://www.lamoda.ru/c/401/clothes-bryuki-shorty-kombinezony/

**16,843 images were received:**
- 8842 blouses images.
- 8001 trousers images.

**Two solutions were implemented as a classifier:**
1. Solution based on the library tensorflow.
2. Solution based on the library pytorch.
